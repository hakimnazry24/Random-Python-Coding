# python-project
My name is Hakim and I am Computer Science student. 
I recently start learning Python, so basically this is where I code my simple Python project. 
I try as much as I can to do the project independently without watching any tutorials.
The code might be scuffed but thats just the process of learning.
Any insights is very much appreciated.
